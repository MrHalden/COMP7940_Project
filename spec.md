## Milestone 1 - Chatbot Design and Setup
- **Q1: Which bot (LINE/web) your team is doing?**
    - A1: Our team is going to do the LINE version.
- **Q2: The design of your chatbot (100 - 1000 words)**
    - A2.1 (ZHU Feng):
    I am going to implement a feature that could help users to find where to buy face masks. For example, the user would send his/her location, then the bot would return the location of the nearby stores currently selling face masks. Meanwhile, the users would be able to choose their preference when searching for face masks, such as nearest first, cheapest first, with or without purchase limit and so on. 
    
    - A2.2 (ZHI Yiyao):
    I am going to set up a bot which can tell the data of Wuhan pneumonia. If the user tell the bot like ‘show the total number’. The bot will tell the map distribution of the pneumonia. If the user type in a place like ‘Hongkong’. The bot will tell the number of infected person in Hongkong. 
    
    - A2.3 (WANG Yuhao):
    The function 3 of the chat bot is that providing various effective measures to prevent new coronavirus.To be specific,when you ask to the bot about how to prevent new coronavirus,it would reply many measures automatically such as correct way to wear a mask,travel advices,etc.
